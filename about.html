		<h2>Mahiigan — The Wolf</h2>
			<div class="about-text"><p>In Anishinaabe tradition, Ma'iingan — the Wolf — walked with the Original Man across all of creation. Together they named every plant, every animal, every stone and stream. When their journey was complete, the Creator told them their paths must diverge. But their fates were bound: what happens to one, happens to the other.</p>

<p>This is not legend. It is the original systems theory — the understanding that all living things exist in relationship, that no part of the web can be damaged without damaging the whole. When the wolf populations declined, the rivers changed course. When the rivers changed, the forests changed. The Anishinaabe knew this before Western ecology had a name for trophic cascades.</p>

<p>Mahiigan.com is a space for Indigenous knowledge as it has always been: living, relational, and sovereign. The knowledge here belongs to the land and the peoples who have stewarded it since time immemorial. It is not a data source to be mined. It is a living system with its own protocols, its own governance, and its own intelligence.</p>

<p>Turtle Island carries the memory of everything that has walked upon it. The birchbark scrolls of the Midewiwin encode knowledge that predates written language. The oral traditions carry frequencies that text cannot hold. The ceremonies create interfaces that technology can only approximate.</p>

<p>The wolf does not explain itself. It moves through the forest, and the forest knows. The knowledge here operates the same way — present for those who can receive it, invisible to those who cannot.</p>
